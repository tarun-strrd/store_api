#store_api
I used expressjs and Mongo Db to create this api. 
This api has features like sorting and numeric filters.
We can pass in query paramters like feilds required,page,limit. T
his will store products from the file products.json fil in the database. 
All the changes made in products.json will reflect in our database.

http://localhost:3000/api/v1/product/ will ive all the products in the list. you can pass in various query parametrs in the route like sort,feilds,numericFilters
